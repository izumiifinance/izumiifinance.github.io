                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><a href="https://izumiifinance.github.io/" class="text-primary">iZUMi Finance</a> is a multi-chain DeFi protocol providing One-Stop Liquidity as a Service (LaaS). Its philosophy is that every token deserves better on-chain liquidity in an efficient and lasting way. As our name “iZUMi” in Japanese signifies, our ultimate goal is to help every partner and token to enjoy on-chain liquidity like spring water, continuous and long-lasting for centuries.
<br>
<br>iZUMi has debuted LiquidBox, iZiSwap, and iUSD three on-chain liquidity products. LiquidBox provides Programmable Liquidity as a Service (LaaS) firstly on Ethereum with Uniswap V3. With the deployment of Uniswap V3 in other Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystems, LiquidBox was also successfully deployed on Arbitrum &amp; Polygon. iZUMi Finance then launched iZiswap on BNB Chain with the innovative Discretized-Liquidity-AMM(DL-AMM) model, which was upgraded from Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity model to implement an AMM mechanism that supports discrete liquidity on every price tick, providing DEX users with a CEX-like trading experience to place limit orders in a non-custodial orderbook way. iZUMi has also successfully issued iZUMi Bond USD (iUSD) and iZUMi Bond, and supported Bond Farming which brings stable fixed income to on-chain investors, providing a high yield level fixed income investment product for users and combining with the TradFi product model of convertible bonds to provide iZUMi Bond investors the Option which can convert to iZi token.
<br>
<br>iZUMi will continue to expand the multi-chain ecology and eventually support cross-chain liquidity trading mechanisms, bring systematic liquidity service to the multi-chain ecosystem, and eventually become a one-stop liquidity service platform with super high capital efficiency in the DeFi industry.<br><br><strong>LiquidBox</strong><br><br>iZUMi’s LiquidBox enhances incentive efficiency, enabling protocols to distribute incentive rewards in certain price ranges. LiquidBox will help liquidity providers earn additional liquidity mining rewards provided by related protocols as well as DEX trading fees. On the other side, LiquidBox solves “pool 2 dilemmas” problems by providing structured-incentive and auto-rebased modules, which could attract more liquidity with a low emission rate for protocols while enabling non-impermanent loss liquidity mining for liquidity providers. This innovative Liquidity Mining mechanism helps protocols attract liquidity in an efficient and lasting way.<strong><br></strong><br></p>

However, the next price increase is just 36 hours away, so there’s no time to wait.<br><strong><br>Concentrated Liquidity<br></strong>The concept of concentrated liquidity is central to iZUMi Finance's offerings.

This approach maximizes capital efficiency, as assets are utilized where they are most needed, leading to better returns for liquidity providers and improved trading conditions for users.<br><br><strong>Dynamic Fee Structure<br></strong>iZUMi Finance employs a dynamic fee structure that adjusts based on market conditions and trading volume. This flexible approach ensures that fees remain competitive, attracting more users to the platform. By aligning fees with market activity, iZUMi Finance can provide a more sustainable and efficient trading environment.<br><br><strong>Incentive Programs<br></strong>To encourage participation and foster growth, iZUMi Finance offers various incentive programs for liquidity providers and traders. These incentives can include token rewards, fee rebates, and other benefits designed to attract and retain users. By providing attractive incentives, iZUMi Finance can build a robust and active user base, contributing to the platform's long-term success.<br><br><strong>Impact on the DeFi Ecosystem<br></strong>Improved Capital Efficiency<br>iZUMi Finance's approach to liquidity management significantly improves capital efficiency within the DeFi ecosystem. By concentrating liquidity in active trading ranges, the platform reduces the amount of idle capital and ensures that assets are used more effectively. This not only benefits liquidity providers through higher returns but also enhances the overall efficiency of the DeFi market.<br><br><strong>Enhanced User Experience<br></strong>The combination of concentrated liquidity and a dynamic fee structure results in a superior trading experience for users. Traders benefit from reduced slippage and better price execution, making iZUMi Finance an attractive choice for both retail and institutional participants. The platform's user-friendly interface and diverse range of supported tokens further enhance its appeal.<br><br><strong>Decentralized Governance<br></strong>The iZUMi DAO model empowers the community to take an active role in shaping the platform's future. By allowing token holders to participate in governance, iZUMi Finance ensures that its development aligns with the needs and preferences of its users. This decentralized approach fosters transparency, accountability, and community engagement, setting a standard for other DeFi projects to follow.<br><br><strong>Follow iZUMi Finance Official Channels:</strong><br><strong>
